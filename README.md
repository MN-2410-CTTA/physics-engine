# 2D Newtonian Physics Engine
## Features
- Gravity as a constant force
- Physics logic and rendering is seperated
- Uses delta time for frame-rate independence
- Ground collision
## Limitations
- Rotational physics not implemented
- Air resistance/drag is ignored
- No collision with other objects
- Only supports simulating one object
- No bouncing when colliding
## Future Improvements
- OOP
- Angular momentum and rotational physics
- Visualisation of forces and vectors
- Friction and air resistance
## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Pygame

Install dependencies with:

```bash
pip install pygame-ce
```
